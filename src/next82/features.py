"""Build the modeling table: one row per player-season, target = games played next season.

Games are measured as a share of the team's schedule (gp_share) so that the
shortened 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons are comparable to 82-game seasons.

Absence features come from matching each player's game log against their
team's schedule, split into stints (consecutive games with one team):
    gap_*      games missed between two appearances with the same team
    missed_start / missed_end
               team games before a player's first appearance / after their last.
               These also capture late signings, releases and buyouts, so they
               are kept separate from mid-stint gaps.

Sat-out seasons: when a player misses a whole season, a row is added for that
season with 0 games played and missed_season = 1 (in-season stats are left blank).
This lets the model learn what happens in comeback years, and lets the app
forecast players who sat out the latest season. Rows are added when the player
played in one of the two seasons before and either returned later (training) or
the season is the latest one and they were a rotation player the season before
(forecast; fringe players who sat out have most likely left the league).

Target rules for a player in season s:
    played in s+1                       -> target = s+1 gp_share
    absent in s+1, returns in any later -> target = 0 (missed the whole season)
    never seen again after s            -> dropped (left the league; can't tell why)
The last season has no target; those rows are what the app forecasts.
